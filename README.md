# Franzino

Franzino is a low cost Arduino standalone board. As its name suggests, is a simple board that has just the basic components so you can use the ATmega328P microcontroller, both for study and for applications in projects.

Unlike standalones available in the market, the Franzino board has pinout Arduino Rev 3 and connector for easy connection of the serial interface. The ease of access to the pins of the serial interface, enables you to connect communication modules according to the needs of the project. You will be able to easily connect serial level converters such as USB, RS232, RS485 and even a Bluetooth module, without the need to use shields.


The Franzino board comes with the Arduino UNO bootloader to facilitating the upload process of your scketch. You can easily upload your sketch to Franzino board using a USB to Serial converter, following the same steps that are already used to your Arduino UNO board.
